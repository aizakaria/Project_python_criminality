## 📚 Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Cleaning (`data_cleaning.ipynb`)

- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Data type conversions
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Initial data quality assessment

**Key Tasks:**
- Missing data analysis
- Duplicate removal
- Date/time formatting
- Data validation

### Step 2: Data Transformation (`data_transformation.ipynb`)

- Feature engineering
- Create derived features (time-based, categorical, etc.)
- Data aggregation and pivoting
- Automated transformation pipelines

**Key Features Created:**
- Temporal features (hour, day, month, quarter)
- Geographic risk scores
- Crime severity indicators
- Weapon involvement flags

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (`exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`)

- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation studies
- Time series analysis
- Comprehensive visualizations

**Analysis Includes:**
- 10+ visualizations
- Temporal patterns (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Geographic distribution
- Victim demographics
- Weapon involvement analysis
- Crime severity trends

### Step 4: Predictive Modeling (`predictive_modeling.ipynb`)

Develop 5 machine learning models:

1. **Crime Category Classification**
   - Predict: Violent, Property, or Other crimes
   - Best Model: Random Forest
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall

2. **Crime Severity Prediction**
   - Predict: Part 1 (Serious) vs Part 2 (Less Serious)
   - Best Model: Gradient Boosting
   - Metrics: AUC-ROC, Accuracy

3. **Weapon Involvement Prediction**
   - Predict: Whether a weapon will be involved
   - Best Model: Random Forest
   - Metrics: F1-Score, Precision, Recall

4. **Crime Occurrence Forecasting**
   - Predict: Number of crimes in future periods
   - Best Model: Random Forest Regressor
   - Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²

5. **Area Risk Score Prediction**
   - Predict: Risk level for different areas
   - Best Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Metrics: R², MAE, RMSE

## 📊 Key Insights

### Crime Patterns

- **Property crimes** are the most prevalent category
- **Peak crime hours**: Late evening (18:00-23:59) and afternoon periods
- **Seasonal trends**: Specific months show higher crime rates
- **Geographic concentration**: Certain areas show significantly higher crime rates

### Demographic Patterns

- Specific age groups are disproportionately affected
- Gender patterns vary significantly by crime type
- Young adults (18-34) and middle-aged (35-49) are most vulnerable

### Weapon Involvement

- Significant portion of violent crimes involve weapons
- Firearm usage varies by area and crime type
- Strong correlation between weapon involvement and crime severity

### Socioeconomic Factors

- Correlation between median income and crime rates
- Population density impacts crime frequency
- Area risk scores strongly predict crime occurrence
